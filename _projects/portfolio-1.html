        <p align="justify">  
         The ubiquity of the computing technologies has brought our daily lives with more convenience and fun. Each individual is involved in and connected to the world via a variety of computing devices and services.  These devices, possibly to be connected, lead to many contact/computing opportunities. However, conventional networking techniques do not optimize in <strong>mobility environments</strong> nor take advantage of <strong>social phenomena</strong>.  My research starts with the routing algorithm design in opportunistic mobile networks, such as vehicular networks and opportunistic mobile  networks, which try to utilize the opportunistic contact. Later on, I moved to routing and scheduling issues  in mobile edge computing, whose objective is to seamlessly merge the increasing mobility demand into existing network infrastructures, resulting in a wide-range of new designs in 5G networks. Along the way, I expanded my interests to address emerging location-aware service optimization in Internet of Things, such as worker recruiting issues in spatial crowdsourcing and trajectory planning in wireless charging.

        <h3>Opportunistic Mobile Networks</h3>
      </p> 
      <p align="justify">  
        It is reported that the estimated number of mobile phone users are 3.3 billion worldwide, which is more than half of the world's population. Most of the mobile phones in the current era are equipped with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cameras, sensors, and numerous other components. Moreover, most of the modern vehicles are also installed with communication interfaces and sensory equipment. Such a widespread use and availability of mobile communication devices create a huge number of contact opportunities among humans. Different from traditional Internet routing, which has a standard routing scheme, the routing schemes in opportunistic mobile networks vary from different applications. Therefore, I proposed several different routing schemes to address different applications.

      <h3>Mobile Edge Computing</h3>
    </p> 
    <p align="justify">  
      Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a new option for network providers challenged to meet consumer demands for improved coverage and greater bandwidth. MEC is a network architecture that enables IT and cloud-computing capabilities at the edge of the cellular network. The main idea behind the architecture is to reduce network congestion and improve applications by performing related processing tasks closer to the end user. The technology is designed to be implemented at cellular base stations, providing rapid deployment of applications and other customer services.

      <h3>Crowdsourcing</h3>
    </p> 
    <p align="justify">  
      With the ubiquity of mobile devices and vehicles equipped with high-fidelity sensors and the development of wireless networks (e.g., WiFi and LTE) in the past years, all kinds of data become widely available and large in amount. Traditional infrastructure-based computing approaches or systems began to show their limitations, i.e, high system implementation cost, difficult to handle dynamic environment and hard to utilize all kinds of big data to accelerate ubiquitous intelligence in real world. To address the aforementioned two challenges, the spatial crowdsourcing, also called participatory crowdsourcing, has emerged in the past few years. The idea of spatial crowdsourcing is to recruit a set of people/vehicles, called workers, to actively collect and report data by using their mobile devices for a given campaign.

      In shared mobility systems research, there is increasing interest in the use of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for improving the resource supply balance and service level of systems. The goal of these techniques is to effectively produce a user incentivization policy scheme to encourage users of a shared mobility system (e.g. bikeshare systems) to slightly alter their travel behavior in exchange for a small monetary incentive. These slight changes in user behavior are intended to over time increase the service level of the shared mobility system and improve its profit margin. Reinforcement learning techniques are gaining popularity as an approach to solve this problem, as they can utilize deep learning for tasks that require many actions and produce a cumulative noisy reward signal. A reinforcement learning policy can be used to provide many incentives to users and then receive the service level of the target mobility system over time as a reward signal. We present an analysis and results of our extensive study on the effects of different frameworks for representing a shared mobility system on reinforcement learning performance for user incentivization, in terms of service level. We utilize bikeshare trip-data from Washington D.C.’s Capital Bikeshare system between 2015 and 2019 in our experiments to produce data-driven simulations for experimentation. In analysis, we show the relationship and effects on service level of user volume / mobility needs, resource supply availability, and incentivization budget. Further, we analyze the effectiveness of various reinforcement algorithms and various framework approaches.
