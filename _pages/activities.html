        <h3>Collaborative AI Inference</h3>
      </p> 
      <p align="justify">  
        State-of-the-art DNN typically consists of many hidden layers with millions of model parameters to enable a high level of abstraction and high accuracy. For example, VGGNet and ResNet, which respectively have millions parameters, are widely used as backbone architectures in deep learning solutions. Recent GPT-3 has 175B parameters.  Complicated DNNs can improve performance but cause computation burden for IoT devices at the same time. Computation offloading is a promising strategy to provide high-accuracy and real-time services in the 5G era. With high-resolution sensors, IoT devices now generate data at a very high speed (e.g., 3 Gbit/s (∼1.4 TB/h) to 40 Gbit/s (∼19 TB/h). Such massive amount of offloading traffic exceeds communication capacity. Latency measurements from real testbeds also indicate high latency in offloading communication. This project will develop a cooperative AI inference mechanism under the emerging edge computing paradigm. A layer-wise cooperative DNN computation offloading optimization is proposed, and the corresponding task assignment and schedule optimization will be developed. The proposed research can dynamically adjust cooperative computation strategy to best utilize available computation and communication resources and thus provide low latency inference.
